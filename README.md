# Macros Examples

Welcome to the **Macros_Examples** repository, a curated collection of macro scripts and code examples used to support the Cisco RoomOS Macros Support Agent.

## Purpose
This repository contains approved macro syntax examples, deprecated patterns, and guidance documentation for troubleshooting and configuring macros on Cisco RoomOS devices. It serves as a knowledge base for the Macros Support Agent to reference and provide accurate responses.

## Structure
 Top 5 Macro Ideas for Troubleshooting Cisco Webex RoomOS Devices:
Diagnose audio issues (e.g., no sound, echo, mic problems)
Troubleshoot video and camera connectivity
Check and optimize network settings (DNS, SIP, VPN)
Automate reboots and firmware updates
Run system diagnostics and retrieve logs

- **/examples**: Contains commonly used macro scripts with clear comments, syntax highlighting, and usage instructions.
- **/deprecated**: Contains examples of deprecated macro syntax along with recommended updates.
- **/guides**: Documentation and setup guides related to macro usage and configuration.

## How It Supports the RoomOS Macros Support Agent
The Macros Support Agent is configured to analyze and reference the macro examples from this repository. It will only use scripts from this repository to provide troubleshooting advice, syntax replacements, and other relevant information. The repository ensures that responses are based on verified, curated examples.

## Usage
- For support engineers: Navigate the repository to find examples and more information about macros.
- For automated agent queries: The agent will look into this repository to resolve macro related queries.

## Contribution
Please submit pull requests for new examples, corrections, or updates to the existing macro scripts following the repository guidelines.

## Agent Code Generation Support
This repository does not contain every macro used in RoomOS environments. Instead, it provides a curated set of examples that the RoomOS Macros Support Agent uses to understand syntax patterns and generate new macro code. These examples are selected to ensure compatibility with current RoomOS standards and avoid deprecated syntax. The Agent is trained to use these examples as reference points to produce clean, error-free macro scripts.
